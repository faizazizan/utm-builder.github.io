Overview
The UTM Campaign Builder is a straightforward tool to streamline the creation of UTM parameters for your marketing campaigns. UTM parameters help you track and analyze campaign performance effectively.

UTM Parameters Explained

1. Source:
Definition: Identifies the origin of your traffic. Typically, it's the platform or website where the user clicked the link.
Example Scenario: If you're running a promotional campaign on Instagram, your source would be "instagram."
makefile

Example: utm_source=instagram

2. Medium:
Definition: Describes the type of traffic, such as email, social media, or CPC advertising.
Example Scenario: If you're sharing a link in an email newsletter, your medium could be "email."
makefile

Example: utm_medium=email

3. Campaign Name:

Definition: Helps track the performance of a specific marketing campaign or promotion.

Example Scenario: If you're launching a holiday discount campaign, your campaign name could be "holiday_discount."
makefile

Example: utm_campaign=holiday_discount

4. Term:

Definition: Often used in paid search to identify the keywords that triggered the ad.

Example Scenario: If you're bidding on the keyword "tech gadgets," your term could be "tech+gadgets."

Example: utm_term=tech+gadgets

5. Content:
Definition: Helps differentiate ads or links that point to the same URL, useful for A/B testing or identifying specific ad elements.
Example Scenario: If you're testing two different ad creatives, your content could be "ad_variant_A."

Example: utm_content=ad_variant_A

Combined Example:
Suppose you're running a Google Ads campaign for a summer sale (source: "google") using display ads (medium: "display"), specifically targeting the keyword "beachwear" (term: "beachwear") with two different ad creatives (content: "ad_variant_A"). The resulting UTM parameters could look like this:

Example URL: https://yourwebsite.com/products/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_term=beachwear&utm_content=ad_variant_A

These UTM parameters enable precise tracking, allowing you to analyze and optimize the performance of different aspects of your marketing strategy.
